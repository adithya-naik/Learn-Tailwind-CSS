 /*  interpretation of @apply:- */
 /* this is to keep/give name to a list of classes aplied */
 /* should be written before @tailwind utilities as if we want to use tailwind css utility classes after that  */
 /* Here the order of importing also places a key role */



 /* need of @layer :-  */
/* so to avoid this i.e order of importing we use @layer <layer name> here name can be base,components ,utilities,*/

/* @layer components{
  .my-btn{
    @apply border  bg-black text-white  active:bg-slate-600 hover:font-semibold hover:bg-slate-950 px-2 rounded-2xl py-1 h-10 w-32;
  }
} */

/* which means the classs inside that layer wil be added after importing all the availabe classes in that layer */
/* major use : lets say we want  a seggt of styles in a class but it is nt available in tailwind css libraray then simply keep @layer utilities as layername  */




/* but at the last using @layer and @Apply is not gonna help us so we will add our custom clases in the config file > themes{
extend {
//inside this
}
}*/


/* npx tailwindcss init confgAdithya --full  */

/* we wil use the above command to geta  default config file with all the availabe constanta and variables presernt in it,by using it as a reference  we can modify our main config file */
